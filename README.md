# Event Registration backend

We needed a more robust system for managing available events as well as
registrations. This is a Flask API which handles logistics for posting,
registering, and managing events.

## Features

-   Google OpenID login
-   Google Calendar integrated
-   Flexible frontend options.
    [Sample Repo](https://github.com/bennettscience/event-registration-front).

Cloning this repo will pull a frontend housed in app/client to get started
quickly.
